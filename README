This app converts the XML timetable from https://is.muni.cz/auth/rozvrh/ to iCalendar format.

It can be useful for:
* automatic profile management on your phone
* dicsovering event collision when planning an appointment
* having the timetable on your phone

This app is not well-tuned, so:
* It is controlled from console. It has no GUI.
* It does not work correctly with some characters, that are entitized (e.g. &nbsp;).
* It does not check the input much.
* Output generation is horribly written, but the main reason is a horrible library.
* The app assumes that every event is once a week, so you have to modify other events.
* The events start from this week. But I think that this is good enough.

Feel free to improve this app :)

== How to build ==
The only prerequisity is Maven. I use Maven 3, but Maven 2 is probably also OK.
Following command creates executable JAR file in target and downloads all dependencies if needed:
mvn package
Downloading all dependencies can take some time when building such project the first time.

== How to run it ==
You have to have installed Java Runtime Environment. I use (and recommend) Oracle/Sun JRE 1.6.*, but it will probably work with another implementations.
You can run in by calling java -jar MuniTimetableToICal-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar <parameters> assuming that you don't have renamed the archive.
