This app converts the XML timetable from https://is.muni.cz/auth/rozvrh/ to iCalendar format.

It can be useful for:
* automatic profile management on your phone
* dicsovering event collision when planning an appointment
* having the timetable on your phone

This app is not well-tuned, so:
* It is controlled from console. It has no GUI.
* It does not work correctly with some characters, that are entitized (e.g. &nbsp;).
* It does not check the input much.
* Output generation is horribly written, but the main reason is a horrible library.
* The app assumes that every event is once a week, so you have to modify other events.
* The events start from this week. But I think that this is good enough.

Feel free to improve this app :)
